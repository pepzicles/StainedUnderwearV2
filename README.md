# Stained Underwear
## Julia Daser and Pepi Ng

This project aims to highlight the amount of time, resources and labour one spends coping with menstruation.
Pepi collected the number of times in which they scrubbed individual underwear stained with menstrual blood over the course of 11 days.

We will be physicalizing this data by building a robotic arm that continuously scrubs a pair of underwear in real-time, according to the data.

We will be creating a web interface that shows a digital clock with the clock running in real time and the dates at which Pepi washed their underwear. The robotic arm will start scrubbing whenever it reached the time at which Pepi washed their underwear according to the data. The dates would be in real-time, to show the ongoing and never-ending labor that is expended on washing one’s stained, bloody underwear. The project will last 11 days- the number of days in which Pepi washed their underwear.

We will also be setting up a Raspberry Pi with a webcam camera that faces the robotic arm throughout these 11 days. The footage from the webcam camera will be live-streamed onto YouTube/ Twitch.

When the user clicks the first knob of the digital clock, the user is brought into an “about” page- essentially a description of the project. When the user clicks on the second knob of the digital clock, the user is brought into the livestream of the robotic arm via Twitch/ YouTube.

**To link Arduino to the web interface, we will be using:**
Npm packages:

- npm express
- npm serialport

Updates:

20 Nov 23:
Successfully set up serial communication between Arduino and Web via node, npm express and nom serial port
Set up object containing data. The object will send data to the web interface and Arduino.
Successfully set up a web interface connected to Arduino and to show current time
Successfully triggered Arduino LED to turn on when it’s a certain time of the day
Successfully iterated through the day numbers once time reaches 12AM
