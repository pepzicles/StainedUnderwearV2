Materials list:
- acryllic sheet
- 3d print filament (white and gray)
- two big servo motors (MG996R Servo Motor)
- two small servo motors (SG90 Micro Servo Motor)
- brush that will scrub the underwear
- M2.5 screws, M3 screws
- water pump
- silicone tubing that fits water pump
- relay
- arduino
- 2 power supplies (5V, 10A & 5V 4A)
- power cable for arduino


To get started, 3D print the robot-arm parts, the sink, the faucet and the brush-holder part. You can find all the 3D printing files in the "Building the Project" - "3d print" folder. 

We followed this tutorial to assemble the robotic arm: https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/

Next, laser cut the ground plate using the prepared laser cut file in the "Building the Project" folder. 
After cutting out the plate, position the sink, Arduino, relay as well as the robotic arm on the desired position,and mark the mounting holes with a permanent marker. 
Carefully use a drill to drill the correct size hole through the ground plate. Don't forget to drill an extra hole for the wires of the servo motors. 
Mount all parts using the M2.5 screws.
